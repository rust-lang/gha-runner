# Changes in this fork

This fork applies two changes to [the official GitHub Actions
runner][official]:

* A new environment variable used to configure the runner is added,
  `RUST_WHITELISTED_EVENT_NAME`. When the variable is set, if a job has a
  different event type than the one allowed by the variable the job will be
  canceled before the build is started on the machine.
* Self-updates are prevented, to avoid the changes in the fork from being
  overridden.

**This is intended to only be used by the Rust Infrastructure Team.** We have
no plans to provide support or continue maintaining this fork, so please don't
rely on it. Thanks!

# GitHub Actions Runner

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/actions/runner/workflows/Runner%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/actions/runner/actions)

The runner is the application that runs a job from a GitHub Actions workflow. It is used by GitHub Actions in the [hosted virtual environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments), or you can [self-host the runner](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/about-self-hosted-runners) in your own environment.

## Get Started

For more information about installing and using self-hosted runners, see [Adding self-hosted runners](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/adding-self-hosted-runners) and [Using self-hosted runners in a workflow](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/using-self-hosted-runners-in-a-workflow)

## Contribute

We accept contributions in the form of issues and pull requests. The runner typically requires changes across the entire system and we aim for issues in the runner to be entirely self contained and fixable here. Therefore, we will primarily handle bug issues opened in this repo and we kindly request you to create all feature and enhancement requests on the [GitHub Feedback](https://github.com/community/community/discussions/categories/actions-and-packages) page. [Read more about our guidelines here](docs/contribute.md) before contributing.
