# Changes in this fork

This fork applies two changes to [the official GitHub Actions
runner][official]:

* A new environment variable used to configure the runner is added,
  `RUST_WHITELISTED_EVENT_NAME`. When the variable is set, if a job has a
  different event type than the one allowed by the variable the job will be
  canceled before the build is started on the machine.
* Self-updates are prevented, to avoid the changes in the fork from being
  overridden.

**This is intended to only be used by the Rust Infrastructure Team.** We have
no plans to provide support or continue maintaining this fork, so please don't
rely on it. Thanks!

# GitHub Actions Runner

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/actions/runner/workflows/Runner%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/actions/runner/actions)

The runner is the application that runs a job from a GitHub Actions workflow. It is used by GitHub Actions in the [hosted virtual environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments), or you can [self-host the runner](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/about-self-hosted-runners) in your own environment.

## Get Started

For more information about installing and using self-hosted runners, see [Adding self-hosted runners](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/adding-self-hosted-runners) and [Using self-hosted runners in a workflow](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/using-self-hosted-runners-in-a-workflow)
